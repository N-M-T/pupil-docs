Pupil Cloud makes it easy for you to collect, securely store, and analyze your eye tracking data. 

Pupil Invisible Companion App integrates seamlessly with [Pupil Cloud](https://cloud.pupil-labs.com "Pupil Cloud - Eye tracking data storage, visualzation, and analysis - Pupil Labs") - facilitating data logistics with robust uploads from Pupil Invisible Companion app to Pupil Cloud's secure cloud storage. 

## Drive
You can play back recordings directly in your web browser, organize your recordings, manage wearers and templates, and enrich data for further analysis.

A project is a group of recordings that can be further reviewed and annotated. 

Enrichments leverage the power of cloud computing and advanced algorithms to calculate high-level features on recordings within a project enabling data aggregation, visualization, and download.

We have a lot of exciting features in the pipeline for Pupil Cloud in the near future!
