Using your Pupil Invisible for the first time? Follow the steps below to get up and running.

<v-divider></v-divider>

## 1. Set up your new Companion Device.

The Companion Device included in your Pupil Invisible box is a new device. It has never been turned on, so it will require setup.

Create a new Google account or use an existing Google account during setup.

## 2. Install and start Pupil Invisible Companion App.

* Launch the Google Play Store app. It is already installed by default on your Companion Device.
* Search for **Pupil Invisible Companion** in the Google Play Store and click install.
* Start the Pupil Invisible Companion App.
* First-time users will need to Sign Up for a Pupil Cloud account. You can Sign Up by using your Google account, or by creating an account with email address and password. Read more about [Pupil Cloud](/cloud/ "Pupil Cloud documentation").
* Follow in-app setup steps.
