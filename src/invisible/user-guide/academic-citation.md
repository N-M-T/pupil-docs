#### Title

A High-Level Description and Performance Evaluation of Pupil Invisible

#### Abstract

Head-mounted eye trackers promise convenient
access to reliable gaze data in unconstrained environments. Due
to several limitations, however, often they can only partially
deliver on this promise.
Among those are the following: (i) the necessity of performing
a device setup and calibration prior to every use of the eye
tracker, (ii) a lack of robustness of gaze-estimation results
against perturbations, such as outdoor lighting conditions and
unavoidable slippage of the eye tracker on the head of the
subject, and (iii) behavioral distortion resulting from social
awkwardness, due to the unnatural appearance of current
head-mounted eye trackers.
Recently, Pupil Labs released Pupil Invisible glasses,
a head-mounted eye tracker engineered to tackle these
limitations. Here, we present an extensive evaluation of
its gaze-estimation capabilities. To this end, we designed a
data-collection protocol and evaluation scheme geared towards
providing a faithful portrayal of the real-world usage of Pupil
Invisible glasses.
In particular, we develop a geometric framework for gauging
gaze-estimation accuracy that goes beyond reporting mean
angular accuracy. We demonstrate that Pupil Invisible glasses,
without the need of a calibration, provide gaze estimates
which are robust to perturbations, including outdoor lighting
conditions and slippage of the headset.
